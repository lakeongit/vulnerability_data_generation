# Hypothetical Vulnerabilities Dataset

This dataset represents a hypothetical set of vulnerabilities for different types of assets you might find in an AWS or Azure environment. Please note that this data is entirely fictional and for illustrative purposes only.

## Dataset Columns

The dataset includes the following columns:

- `Asset_Type`: The type of asset that the vulnerability applies to (e.g., EC2, S3, RDS, etc.)
- `Vulnerability_ID`: A unique identifier for the vulnerability (like a CVE ID).
- `Vulnerability_Summary`: A brief summary of what the vulnerability is.
- `Disclosure_Date`: The date the vulnerability was first publicly disclosed.
- `Remediation_Guidance`: Recommended steps to remediate the vulnerability.
- `Criticality`: The criticality level of the vulnerability, ranging from Low to Critical.

## Creating the Dataset

The dataset was created using a Python script that generates random data for each of the columns. The `faker` library was used to generate the `Vulnerability_Summary`, `Disclosure_Date`, and `Remediation_Guidance` columns. The `Criticality` column was populated with a random choice from the list `["Low", "Medium", "High", "Critical"]`.

## Using the Dataset

You can use this dataset to simulate vulnerability assessment exercises, test data visualization tools, or for any other purpose where you need a sample dataset of cloud vulnerabilities. To use the dataset, simply load it into your data analysis tool of choice. For example, in Python with pandas, you can load the dataset with:

```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('hypothetical_vulnerabilities.csv')
